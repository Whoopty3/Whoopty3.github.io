        <h1>Player Descriptions/Analysis</h1>
        <h2><strong>Damian Lillard</strong></h2>
        <img src = "images/Damian Lillard.jpeg">
        <p>Point guard for the Milwaukee Bucks. Averaged 24 points per game, 4.5 rebounds per game, and 7 assists per game with a true shooting percentage of 59.0. Additionally, Lillard was named an all star for the 8th time of his career, last season. Now, heading into his 13th year, some areas of his game that could be strengthened would be his ability to finish around the rim through contact, hitting the split pass more frequently out of the pick and roll action, and remaining aggressive rather than deferring in pivotal moments.</p>
        <h2><strong>O.G. Anunoby</strong></h2>
        <img src = "images/OG Anunoby.jpeg">
        <p>Small forward for the New York Knicks. Averaged 14.7 Points per Game, 4.2 Rebounds Per Game, and 2.1 Assists per game with a true shooting percentage of 59.5. OG's defensive instincts is what makes him one of the most sought after assets in the NBA. His ability to shut down the opponents best players on a nightly basis rewarded him a 5 year $212,500,000 this past season. Improvements that can be made going into next season: adding a more formidable mid range jumper, movement shooting in general, and one on one play.</p>
